# HahnTrack
HahnTrack is a full-stack CRUD application designed for managing and tracking maintenance tasks for industrial equipment. Built using Java (Spring Boot) and React.js, it enables users to create, update, and monitor tasks related to machinery maintenance across factory floors or municipal infrastructures.

This project was developed as part of an assessment, inspired by Hahn Softwareâ€™s focus on digital transformation in the mechanical, infrastructure, and public sectors.
